\section{Circuit Explanation}
A 16:4 Encoder circuit has been used for this lab. The encoder circuit is consisted of 16 input ports and 5 output ports. The purpose of the encoder is to get the number of low input bits from 16 bit input until the first high bit appears. 4 outputs represents the number of low inputs until the first high input named CODE, and the one remaining input represents ERROR which is high when none of the input bit is high. Since we have 16 bit inputs, there are 2^16 = 65534 possible combinations and CODE is in range of 0 to 15.
