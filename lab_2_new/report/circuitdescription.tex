\section{Circuit Description}
The keyboard encoder circuit takes a 64 bit input, and returns a 7 bit output. The 7 bit output represents the ascii code of the selected key, with each input line representing a single key. The codes are mapped from " " (space character, ascii 32) on the 0th input, to "_" (underscore, ascii 95) on the 63rd input. \\
This ordering was chosen as the simplest conversion from key index to an appropriate ascii code. \\
